/**
 * This is a "constant octet size random serial number generator".
 * (note that this generator is not designed to generated a specified level of entropy, although the entropy will be fixed and can easily calculated according to the below rules.)
 * 
 * The purpose of this certificate serial number generator is to generate random serial numbers with a fixed octet size. If you specify the octet size 
 * to be 8 octets, the serial number will be 8 octets, if you specify 20 octets it will be 20 octets, etc.
 * To achieve this the following process is performed:
 * 
 * - The specified number of octets is retrieved from a CSPRNG (SecureRandom).
 * - The octets are converted into a positive BigInteger (serial numbers are ASN.1 INTEGERs) by taking the absolute value of the BigInteger 
 *   created from the random bytes 
 * - If this integer does not fulfill requirements and limitations specified by RFC5280 and X.690, the serial number is discarded
 * - This process is repeated with new octets from the CSPRNG until an integer fulfilling the tests has been retrieved.
 * -- This integer is returned as the serial number from the generator 
 * 
 * RFC 5280 defines serialNumber be a positive INTEGER.
 * 
 * Simply using an integer conforming to RFC5280 will lead to variable length encoding of the serial number in the certificate. 
 * If the (random) integer 3 is retrieved from the CSPRNG it will be encoded as '03' and the number 65535 as 'FFFF', etc. Also if the number is too 
 * large, ASN.1 integers being in two-complement representation, it will be encoded as 9 bytes.
 * 
 * To achieve fixed octet length serials we apply restrictions according to X.690. X.690 defines that INTEGER consist of one or more octets,
 * and also defines as follows:
 *   If the contents octets of an integer value encoding consist of more than one octet, then the bits of the first octet and bit 8 of the second octet:
 *   a) shall not all be ones; and b) shall not all be zero.
 * This sets minimum and maximum boundaries for the integer.
 *   Minimum 4 octets value is 00800000 and maximum value is 7FFFFFFF."
 *   Minimum 8 octets value is 0080000000000000 and maximum value is 7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF."
 * Simply extend with '00' and 'FF' for other octet sizes. 
 * 
 * X.690:
 * 8.3 Encoding of an integer value 8.3.1 The encoding of an integer value shall be primitive. The contents octets shall consist of one or more
 * octets. 8.3.2 If the contents octets of an integer value encoding consist of more than one octet, then the bits of the first octet and bit 8 of the
 * second octet: a) shall not all be ones; and b) shall not all be zero. NOTE – These rules ensure that an integer value is always encoded in the
 * smallest possible number of octets. 8.3.3 The contents octets shall be a two's complement binary number equal to the integer value, and consisting
 * of bits 8 to 1 of the first octet, followed by bits 8 to 1 of the second octet, followed by bits 8 to 1 of each octet in turn up to and including
 * the last octet of the contents octets. NOTE – The value of a two's complement binary number is derived by numbering the bits in the contents
 * octets, starting with bit 1 of the last octet as bit zero and ending the numbering with bit 8 of the first octet. Each bit is assigned a numerical
 * value of 2N, where N is its position in the above numbering sequence. The value of the two's complement binary number is obtained by summing the
 * numerical values assigned to each bit for those bits which are set to one, excluding bit 8 of the first octet, and then reducing this value by the
 * numerical value assigned to bit 8 of the first octet if that bit is set to one.
